                HTML is short for HyperText
                 Markup Language.Basically,
                  itÃ¢Â€Â™s the Ã¢Â€ÂœcodeÃ¢Â€Â
                   behind every webpage Ã¢Â€Â“
                    even this one. If youÃ¢Â€Â™re just
                     beginning to learn HTML, let us tell
                      you that itÃ¢Â€Â™s a fairly easy task.
                       HTML, without styling, canÃ¢Â€Â™t do 
                       anything more than setting a layout, 
                       drawing a table, or creating frames 
                       Ã¢Â€Â“ but it is handy as it helps
                        you structure the content correctly
                        , which is important when you sit 
                        down to add style to your HTML.

                However simple this might seem, it is
                 a mighty useful tool when it comes to
                  full-fledged web development. Various 
                  tools easily eliminate the HTML coding 
                  from your work process Ã¢Â€Â“ but if you
                   want to be in full control of your web-page,
                    youÃ¢Â€Â™ll need to have some command over 
                    HTML.
             Through this article, we aim to give you the
              essential HTML building blocks thatÃ¢Â€Â™ll
               help you get up and running. Reading this,
                youÃ¢Â€Â™ll be able to understand an HTML 
                source code and even modify it for your own
                 good!

    Tags are what youÃ¢Â€Â™ll see the most when
     you look at any HTML source code. A tag can ideally 
     be seen as a wrapper to any item on your HTML document
     . Tags tell what magic is to be done on the content 
     enclosed by them.
    Let look at two types of tags:
&lt; tag-example-1 &gt; I need a closign 
tag &lt;tag-example-1 &gt;
&lt; tag-example-2 &sol; &gt; I don't need a cloding tag.
In the first example, the sentence is wrapped 
by two tags. The first one is called the opening
 tag and the second one is called the closing tag.
  Everything in between is affected by the properties
   of the tag. Very commonly used examples of such tags are.

The second example tags about loner tags  as in, 
they ™t need a closing tag to function. Although 
itÃ¢Â€Â™s not required, these type of tags are often
 written as  to make the debugging of code easier. 
 Common examples of such tags are  used for horizontal 
 line,  Ã¢Â€Â“ to break the line, etc.

            <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
You now know enough to skim through and understand
 any part of an HTML code. We request you
  to go ahead and try skimming through the 
  source code of any website (youÃ¢Â€Â™ll 
  find some tags you donÃ¢Â€Â™t know, but 
  thatÃ¢Â€Â™s how you learn!). Oh, and welcome
   to the world of web development. With HTML 
   under your belt, your next stop should be 
   making your page look beautiful using CSS.

 article, and donÃ¢Â€Â™t forget to have a 
 look at a source code or two!
